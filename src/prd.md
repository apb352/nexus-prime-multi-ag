## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke a sense of being in an advanced, living digital space where AI entities feel like real companions with distinct personalities.

**Design Personality**: Cutting-edge, sleek, and slightly mysterious with neon accents that suggest advanced technology while maintaining warmth and approachability.

**Visual Metaphors**: Digital apartment complex, neural networks, holographic interfaces, living technology

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with sophisticated 3D elements balanced by clean, intuitive controls

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Cyberpunk with complementary and triadic variations

**Primary Colors**: 
- Cyberpunk: Deep blues and purples with neon accents
- Minimalist: Clean whites and grays with subtle color highlights  
- Cozy: Warm earth tones with golden accents

**Secondary Colors**: Vibrant accent colors for agent differentiation (purple, pink, amber, emerald, blue, red, cyan, lime)

**Color Psychology**: Cool blues suggest technology and trust, neon accents create excitement, warm secondary colors add personality

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single, versatile font family (Inter) with multiple weights for consistency
**Font Personality**: Modern, clean, slightly futuristic but highly readable
**Typography Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, labels, body text, and UI elements

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: 3D avatars as focal points, floating chat windows as secondary focus, background elements recede
**Grid System**: Responsive grid for agent cards, flexible positioning for chat windows
**Responsive Approach**: Adaptive layouts that maintain usability across device sizes

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Breathing animations for avatars suggest life, smooth transitions maintain immersion
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Avatar animations > window transitions > UI hover effects
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Subtle, smooth animations that enhance rather than distract

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Architecture
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Three.js for 3D avatar rendering and animations
- KV storage for data persistence
- Modular component architecture for maintainability

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient 3D rendering with proper cleanup
- Optimized re-renders for chat history
- Smooth animations without blocking UI

### Scalability Needs
- Expandable agent types and customization options
- Additional chat features (voice, group mode)
- Enhanced 3D graphics and interactions

## Current Implementation Status
