# Nexus Prime - Multi-Agent AI Chat Platform

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: Nexus Prime is an immersive, futuristic platform where users can interact with multiple AI agents simultaneously through 3D avatars, creating a living digital environment that feels like communicating with sentient beings in a virtual apartment complex.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Users can easily customize and personalize AI agents with names, moods, and visual characteristics
- Seamless multi-window chat experience with visual distinction between agents
- Smooth 3D avatar animations that respond to agent activity states
- Persistent chat history and agent configurations across sessions
- AI agents can speak with unique, customizable voice profiles
- Voice synthesis enhances the immersive experience of interacting with digital beings

**Experience Qualities**: Futuristic, Immersive, Personalized

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality with persistent state, multiple UI components, 3D rendering)

**Primary User Activity**: Interacting - Users engage in conversations with AI agents while customizing their characteristics and managing multiple simultaneous chat sessions.

## Essential Features

### 3D Human Avatars
- **Functionality**: Realistic 3D human avatars with different body types, hairstyles, and tech accessories
- **Purpose**: Create emotional connection and visual distinction between AI agents
- **Success Criteria**: Smooth animation, responsive to agent states, visually appealing rendering

### Agent Customization
- **Functionality**: Edit agent names, moods, avatar types, colors, and personality descriptions
- **Purpose**: Allow users to personalize their AI companions to match preferences
- **Success Criteria**: Easy-to-use editing interface, immediate visual feedback, persistent storage

### Multi-Window Chat System
- **Functionality**: Resizable, draggable chat windows for simultaneous conversations
- **Purpose**: Enable parallel interactions with multiple agents
- **Success Criteria**: Smooth window management, clear visual hierarchy, responsive layout

### Chat History Persistence
- **Functionality**: Store conversation history per agent using KV storage
- **Purpose**: Maintain context across sessions and allow users to review past conversations
- **Success Criteria**: Reliable data persistence, fast retrieval, organized by agent

### Voice Synthesis & Speech
- **Functionality**: AI agents can speak responses with unique voice profiles, customizable pitch, rate, and volume
- **Purpose**: Create more immersive interactions and bring digital agents to life with distinct vocal personalities
- **Success Criteria**: Clear speech synthesis, customizable voice settings, seamless integration with chat flow

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke a sense of being in an advanced, living digital space where AI entities feel like real companions with distinct personalities.

**Design Personality**: Cutting-edge, sleek, and slightly mysterious with neon accents that suggest advanced technology while maintaining warmth and approachability.

**Visual Metaphors**: Digital apartment complex, neural networks, holographic interfaces, living technology

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with sophisticated 3D elements balanced by clean, intuitive controls

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Cyberpunk with complementary and triadic variations

**Primary Colors**: 
- Cyberpunk: Deep blues and purples with neon accents
- Minimalist: Clean whites and grays with subtle color highlights  
- Cozy: Warm earth tones with golden accents

**Secondary Colors**: Vibrant accent colors for agent differentiation (purple, pink, amber, emerald, blue, red, cyan, lime)

**Color Psychology**: Cool blues suggest technology and trust, neon accents create excitement, warm secondary colors add personality

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single, versatile font family (Inter) with multiple weights for consistency
**Font Personality**: Modern, clean, slightly futuristic but highly readable
**Typography Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, labels, body text, and UI elements

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: 3D avatars as focal points, floating chat windows as secondary focus, background elements recede
**Grid System**: Responsive grid for agent cards, flexible positioning for chat windows
**Responsive Approach**: Adaptive layouts that maintain usability across device sizes

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Breathing animations for avatars suggest life, smooth transitions maintain immersion
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Avatar animations > window transitions > UI hover effects
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Subtle, smooth animations that enhance rather than distract

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Architecture
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Three.js for 3D avatar rendering and animations
- KV storage for data persistence
- Modular component architecture for maintainability

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient 3D rendering with proper cleanup
- Optimized re-renders for chat history
- Smooth animations without blocking UI

### Scalability Needs
- Expandable agent types and customization options
- Additional chat features (voice, group mode)
- Enhanced 3D graphics and interactions

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features
✅ 3D Human Avatar System
- Realistic human avatars with heads, bodies, limbs, and accessories
- Different avatar types: female-tech, male-engineer, android-fem, cyber-male, ai-researcher, neural-net
- Dynamic materials and lighting based on agent colors
- Breathing animations and activity-based scaling
- Tech accessories for cyberpunk variants

✅ Agent Customization Interface
- Modal editor with avatar preview
- Name and mood editing (with presets and custom options)
- Avatar type selection with descriptive labels
- Color picker with curated presets
- Personality description editing

✅ Enhanced Agent Cards
- Edit button on hover for easy access to customization
- Support for optional/empty names and moods
- Improved visual hierarchy with conditional rendering

✅ Persistent Agent Storage
- KV-based storage for agent configurations
- Real-time updates across all components
- Graceful handling of missing data

### Architecture Decisions
- Used Three.js for realistic 3D human avatars instead of geometric shapes
- Implemented modal-based editing for intuitive user experience
- Created reusable avatar type system for future expansion
- Applied consistent color theming across 3D and UI elements

## Next Priority Features
1. Voice synthesis integration for agent personalities
2. Group chat mode for multi-agent conversations
3. Advanced avatar customization (clothing, accessories)
4. Chat history search and export functionality
5. Agent memory and personality learning systems
