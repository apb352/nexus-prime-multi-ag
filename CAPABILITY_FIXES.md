# Capability Communication Fixes

## Summary
Fixed the AI agent communication to accurately explain internet and image generation limitations in the Nexus Prime environment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Image Service Updates (`src/lib/image-service.ts`)
- Updated `generateImage()` method to clarify it creates "artistic representations" rather than "AI images"
- Modified `generateAIImage()` to explicitly explain environment limitations
- Changed watermark text from "AI Generated" to "Artistic Representation"
- Added clear documentation about canvas-based rendering vs. external AI services

### 2. Chat Utilities (`src/lib/chat-utils.ts`)
- Updated image context messaging to explain "artistic visualization capabilities"
- Added `getCapabilityExplanation()` function with standardized explanations for:
  - Internet access limitations (simulated data vs. real-time)
  - Image generation capabilities (canvas algorithms vs. AI services)
  - Combined explanation for both capabilities

### 3. Chat Window Updates (`src/components/ChatWindow.tsx`)
- Modified welcome messages to use "Artistic Visualization" terminology
- Updated image generation disabled message with technical explanation
- Added capability question detection for automatic explanations
- Imported and integrated `getCapabilityExplanation()` function

## What Agents Now Explain

### Internet Access
✅ **What works:** Simulated search results, weather simulations, time/date
⚠️ **Limitations:** No real-time web access, simulated rather than live data

### Image Generation  
✅ **What works:** Canvas-based artistic rendering, multiple styles, high quality
⚠️ **Limitations:** No external AI image services, uses algorithmic generation

### Automatic Responses
The system now automatically detects when users ask questions like:
- "Can you use the internet?"
- "Do you have internet access?"
- "Can you generate images?"
- "Can you draw pictures?"
- "What can you do?"

And provides clear, honest explanations about capabilities and limitations.

## Benefits
1. **Transparency:** Users understand exactly what the system can and cannot do
2. **Accuracy:** No misleading claims about unavailable features
3. **Helpful:** Still encourages use of available capabilities
4. **Educational:** Explains the technical reasons for limitations
